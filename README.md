## üìñ Usage

You can find the main panel of the addon in the **Shader Editor**. Press `N` to open the sidebar, and click on the **"Tool"** tab.

### Basics

* **Auto Color:** Toggles the automatic coloring of new frames on or off.
* **Color Mode:** Choose between two main modes:
    * **Random:** Colors new frames with a completely random color (default).
    * **By Rules:** Uses the rule and palette system described below.

### Creating Rules and Palettes (in the Addon Preferences)

To create rules, open the addon preferences (`Edit -> Preferences -> Add-ons` and search for "Smart Frame Colorizer").

1.  **Set the `Color Mode` to `By Rules`.**
2.  **Create Palettes:**
    * Go to the "Palettes" section and create a new palette.
    * Give it a name and choose a `Sampling Mode` (e.g., `Gradient`).
    * Add colors ("Swatches"). Depending on the mode, you can also set the `Weight` or the `Position` on the gradient here.
3.  **Create Rules:**
    * **Keyword-Based Rules:** Triggered if the frame's label contains the keyword (e.g., a rule with the keyword "UVs" will color all frames that have "UVs" in their label).
    * **Node-Based Rules:** Triggered if a node of a specific type (e.g., an `Image Texture` node) is inside the frame.
4.  **Link Rules to Palettes:**
    * In each rule, you can set the `Mode` to `Use Palette` and enter the name of one of your created palettes.

### Manual Control (in the N-Panel)

* **Quick Color Popup:** Select one or more frames and click this to choose a color from a picker and apply it directly.
* **Update Selected/All:** Manually apply your defined rules to the selected frames or to all frames in the current node tree.
* **Reset Selected/All:** Removes the custom color from the selected or all frames.

### Shortcuts (in the Node Editor)

All shortcuts use the `Shift + Alt` combination.

| Action                 | Shortcut            |
